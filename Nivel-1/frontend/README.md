# Simple backend introduction

The goal of this litle projects is to introduce the React concepts, such as components, properties, state and immutability.


I developed a simple React frontend to show and add new objects to NodeJS backend.
It's made using plugins such as axios to connect to the API,  some babel features, loaders and webpack configuration.
