# Simple backend introduction

The goal of this litle projects is to introduce the concepts of the HTTP Methods, API and routes using express in NodeJS.

I developed four routes to list, create, update and delete items into an array.
I used the uuidv4 to generate unique ids for the created projects via Insomnia.
